# Parsing-Financial-Statements-with-Python

In this Project I make use of the SEC API  to obtain JSON files of a companies financial statements (10-k and 10-Q filings) to convert them form JSON to a pandas data frame. 
Using the Pandas data frame I plan on building an automated LBO Model that will generate an LBO + DCF Model of a given company using Python without needing to build it manually over excel.
